# IncompressibleNavierStokes

[IncompressibleNavierStokes](https://github.com/agdestein/IncompressibleNavierStokes.jl) is
a package providing energy-conserving solvers for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations
on a staggered Cartesian grid. It is based on the Matlab package
[INS2D](https://github.com/bsanderse/INS2D)/[INS3D](https://github.com/bsanderse/INS3D).
