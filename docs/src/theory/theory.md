# Theory

The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are given by

```math
\begin{align*}
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} & = \mathbf{0}, \\
\frac{\mathrm{d} \mathbf{u}}{\mathrm{d} t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u} & = -\nabla p +
\nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{f}.
\end{align*}
```

where ``\mathbf{u}`` is the velocity field, ``p`` is the pressure, ``\nu`` is
the kinematic viscosity, and ``\mathbf{f}`` is the body force.
