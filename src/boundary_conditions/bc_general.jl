    bc_general(Nt, Nin, Nb)

Total solution `u` is written as `u = Bb*ub + Bin*uin`

The boundary conditions can be written as `Bbc*u = ybc`

Then `u` can be written entirely in terms of `uin` and `ybc` as:
`u = (Bin-Btemp*Bbc*Bin)*uin + Btemp*ybc`,
where `Btemp = Bb/(Bbc*Bb)`.

`Bb`, `Bin` and `Bbc` depend on type of bc (Neumann/Dirichlet/periodic) `val1` and `val2`
can be scalars or vectors with either the value or the derivative (ghost) points on
boundary/grid lines
