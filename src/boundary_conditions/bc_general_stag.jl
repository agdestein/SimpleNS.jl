"""
Total solution u is written as `u = Bb*ub + Bin*uin`
The boundary conditions can be written as
`Bbc*u = ybc`
Then u can be written entirely in terms of uin and ybc as:
`u = (Bin-Btemp*Bbc*Bin)*uin + Btemp*ybc`,
where
`Btemp = Bb*(Bbc*Bb)^(-1)`
`Bb`, `Bin` and `Bbc` depend on type of BC (Neumann/Dirichlet/periodic)
Val1 and val2 can be scalars or vectors with either the value or the
derivative
(ghost) points on staggered locations (pressure lines)
