"""
Total solution u is written as
`u = Bb*ub + Bin*uin`
The boundary conditions can be written as
`Bbc*u = ybc`
Then `u` can be written entirely in terms of `uin` and `ybc` as:
`u = (Bin-Btemp*Bbc*Bin)*uin + Btemp*ybc`,
where `Btemp = Bb*(Bbc*Bb)^(-1)`
`Bb`, `Bin` and `Bbc` depend on type of BC (Neumann/Dirichlet/periodic)
