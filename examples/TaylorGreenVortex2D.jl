# # Taylor-Green vortex - 2D
#
# In this example we consider the Taylor-Green vortex.

# We start by loading packages.
# A [Makie](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl) plotting backend is needed
# for plotting. `GLMakie` creates an interactive window (useful for real-time
# plotting), but does not work when building this example on GitHub.
# `CairoMakie` makes high-quality static vector-graphics plots.
