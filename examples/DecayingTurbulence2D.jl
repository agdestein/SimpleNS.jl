# # Decaying Homogeneous Isotropic Turbulence - 2D
#
# In this example we consider decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence,
# similar to the cases considered in [Kochkov2021](@cite) and
# [Kurz2022](@cite). The initial velocity field is created randomly, but with a
# specific energy spectrum. Due to viscous dissipation, the turbulent features
# eventually group to form larger visible eddies.

# We start by loading packages.
# A [Makie](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl) plotting backend is needed
# for plotting. `GLMakie` creates an interactive window (useful for real-time
# plotting), but does not work when building this example on GitHub.
# `CairoMakie` makes high-quality static vector-graphics plots.
